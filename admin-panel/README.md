# Organization Admin Panel

A lightweight React + Vite admin console for managing organizations through the backend API.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A running backend instance (default: `http://localhost:8000`) with a valid bearer token

## Quickstart

```bash
cd admin-panel
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed URL (default `http://localhost:5173`), paste your bearer token, and use the UI to:

- Create new organizations
- List organizations where you are a member
- Delete organizations (admin-only)
